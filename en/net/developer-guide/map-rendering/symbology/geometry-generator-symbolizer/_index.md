## **Geometry GeneratorÂ Symbolizer**
The Geometry Generator Symbolizer is one of advanced symbolizers. It provides a way to substitute the feature geometry with a one modified for a symbolizer.

In this example, we have drawn points as circles. To do this, we used the GetBuffer function, which increases the point by a specified radius.
