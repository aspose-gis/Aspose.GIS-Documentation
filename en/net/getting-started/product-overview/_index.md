description: GIS C#.NET Library can be used to retrieve and edit geographic data in vector-based geo-spatial data formats. Most major GIS file formats, such as ESRI Shapefile, GeoJSON, KML, and GPX files, may be read, written, and converted from within your.NET applications without the need for any additional tools or software. Basic geometries such as Point, MultiPoint, Line, Multiline, and Polygon are supported by the API and can be used to construct complicated features in supported file formats.

Aspose.GIS for .NET allows you to work with GIS data. Besides being simple to use and deploy, it offers benefits of security advantages as a result of 100% managed code. The API's uniform model for working with ShapeFile and GeoJSON lets you work with these file formats without worrying about the internal file structure of these two formats.

The API has the capability to work with a number of geometrical features. It supports basic geometries such as Point, MultiPoint, Line, Multiline, Polygon that can be used to generate complex features as part of supported file formats.

Not only the API supports reading and writing supported file formats, it also offers inter-conversion between these file formats with just a single line of code. This provides the ease of working with these file formats for conversion purposes.
