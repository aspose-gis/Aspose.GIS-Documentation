description: Using GIS C# Library API, read features, points, and geometries from a CSV file and export them to a CSV file.

GIS C# Library Aspose.GIS lets you read features from comma-separated values (CSV) files. At present, the API doesn't provide the facility to create a new GPX file and only reading is supported.
