## **Rule-Based Labeling**
The Rule-Based Labeling applies other labelings to feature geometries based on arbitrary rules coded in C#.

If several rules match a feature, all matching labelings will be applied. You can specify a labeling to apply to features that didn't match any rules by callingÂ [AddElseRule](https://reference.aspose.com/gis/net/aspose.gis.rendering.labelings/rulebasedlabeling/methods/addelserule).
