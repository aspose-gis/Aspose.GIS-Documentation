## **Marker Cluster Symbolizer**
The Marker Cluster Symbolizer is one of advanced symbolizers. It allows the clustering of markers in the specified distance.

In this example, we have drawn cluster centers as red circles. Also, we have drawn all nested cluster points by using different colors. To do this, we used the FeaturesBasedConfiguration function, which setups own style for each cluster.
