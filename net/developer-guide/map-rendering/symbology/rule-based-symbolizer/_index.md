## **Rule-Based Symbolizer**
The Rule-Based Symbolizer is the most flexible symbolizer. It applies other symbolizers to feature geometries based on arbitrary rules coded in C#.

If several rules match a feature, all matching symbolizers will be applied. You can specify a symbolizer to apply to features that didn't match any rules by callingÂ [AddElseRule](https://reference.aspose.com/gis/net/aspose.gis.rendering.symbolizers/rulebasedsymbolizer/methods/addelserule).
