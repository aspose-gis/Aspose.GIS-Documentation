## **LayeredÂ Symbolizer**
The Layered symbolizer draws a feature with several symbolizers on top of each other. You can select from two rendering order modes:

- [RenderOrder.ByFeatures](https://reference.aspose.com/gis/net/aspose.gis.rendering.symbolizers/renderingorder) - draw the first feature with all symbolizers added to the layered symbolizer, then proceed with drawing the next feature.
- [RenderOrder.ByLayers](https://reference.aspose.com/gis/net/aspose.gis.rendering.symbolizers/renderingorder) - draw all features with the first symbolizer, then draw all features with the next symbolizer.
### **Rendering by Features**
